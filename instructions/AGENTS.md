Skills live in `node_modules/ux-atlas/skills/**/SKILL.md`. Each file's `name` and `description` are the disclosure layer. The body is the rule set.

Read only the name and description. When a description matches the request, read that body and follow it. If several match, read the most specific one. Do not read every body up front.

If a `DESIGN.md` is at the project root, follow it for terminology, casing, and a length limit. Follow it for those three. Do not replace that file when UX Atlas updates.

## Always on

For any UI, UX, accessibility, or component work, apply this constitution. It supersedes a narrower skill when they conflict. The full text, including edge cases, is `node_modules/ux-atlas/skills/ux-constitution/SKILL.md`. Read that body when the task needs a threshold, exception, or example this summary does not settle.

1. **Interaction:** Provide immediate visual feedback (loading, success, error). Prevent errors with constrained inputs. Always provide a non-destructive exit (Cancel or Undo).
2. **Psychology:** Minimize cognitive load. Break complex forms into steps. Primary actions are at least 44×44px and easy to reach.
3. **Perception:** Group related elements with spacing and surfaces. Interactive elements must look distinct from static ones.
4. **Inclusivity:** WCAG 2.1 AA. Semantic HTML. 4.5:1 text contrast. Do not remove `:focus-visible` without an equal replacement. Dynamic updates use `aria-live`.
5. **Confirmation:** After a skill would execute, implement, or change the interface or the flow, stop and ask before changing the product. Write the work first. Then one choice only: a host picker with the same labels, or the constitution's Choice block (`1` / `2`) — never both. The size does not matter. There is no exemption.

If a result breaks one of these, it is broken.
